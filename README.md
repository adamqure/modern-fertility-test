Coding Exercise Prompt
Congratulations! We’re very excited to move forward with you to the next step in the interview process – a coding exercise!
This exercise is intended to see how you build and organize a simple iOS app. We don’t expect perfect code or all edge cases to be handled. It’s mostly about building something, so we can have a discussion around the technical decisions you made.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need any clarifications. Thanks again for your time and energy. We sincerely appreciate it! And we hope you enjoy the exercise!
Prompt
So many of our customers are excited to share about their fertility journey. We’ve decided to build a social media app to allow users to post photos and a brief description. This will very much be a v1/“minimum lovable product”, so we are looking to build only two things:
1. A home screen to show a list of images
2. When a user taps on a photo, we should open the image in a modal and show it in full screen
Example home screen and detail view below:
We have already prepared an API which returns some JSON formatted and ready to go. You can access it here:

We are excited to get the ‘core experience’ of the app in our hands. Since this is the initial version, you can use whatever technology choices you want when creating this amazing new app. We will be sure to ask you about them.
   
Also, because this is a v1, there are things we don’t need:
- Login
- Perfect code
- Every edge case covered
Expectations
Please submit your code as either a zipped Git repository or a link to a Github repo, whatever is easiest for you, within a week. And maybe include anything we need to know to get it running in the README. Please limit the time you spend on this exercise to 1 to 2 hours.
If everything looks good, plan to spend 1 hour together with our lead iOS engineer. In that session, be prepared to talk about decisions and tradeoffs you made along the way!
